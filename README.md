AsciiWWDC at http://asciiwwdc.com/ is a great resource for the full-text transcripts of WWDC sessions. And there's something a little poetic about the way the transcripts are listed.

Given a session number, this python script attempts to scan the transcript of a single session for possible haikus (that is, sentences with a 5-7-5 syllable pattern).
## Usage:
````
$ ./wwdc-haiku 228

And what happens is 
you choose that and you see a 
window like this pop 


So, it's going to 
look very similar to 
the last example 


And actually 
I'm backing it this time by 
a dictionary 


So, a lot of you 
I'm sure are familiar with 
Grand Central Dispatch 


It's just one of those 
things that it takes a while to 
get into your head 


I think the two most 
useful and interesting 
ones are max and min 


It's returning a 
Boolean whether or not 
it was successful 


So, was that that was 
pretty fast, but I think we 
hit everybody 
````
````
$ ./wwdc-haiku 310
We're going to start 
pretty basic and get a 
little more complex 


So, this is great if 
you have many types of Push 
Notifications 


I'm going to show 
you a little bit about 
the technology 


And you can know which 
entrance the user is for 
the guide to meet them 


You can just use your 
app as a museum guide 
with this kind of stuff 


Now, let me show you 
how this actually works 
on the real device 


You can see the app 
is smart enough to swap the 
information page 


And the app is still 
ranging as long as you are 
in the museum 


So, go out there and 
use them but use them wisely, 
use them properly
